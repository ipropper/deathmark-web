                        <h1>Deathmark: A Game Where Everybody Dies</h1>
                        <p>Deathmark is a fast-paced first-person-shooter and puzzler game where players make a
                           deal with a shinigami, a death god, to become a shade; a soulless creature
                           who, upon dying, teleports to the body of its most recent victim.</p>

                        <h2>Downloads:</h2>
                        <p>We recommend downloading the appropriate version and then playing the game with the highest
                        quality settings. A high end graphics card may be needed. It is also possible to play Deathmark
                        online, but at a quality loss.

                        <h2>The Deathmark</h2>
                        <p>The concept of the deathmark quickly distinguishes this game from others in the first-person-shooter
                        genre. When the player dies, their body is teleported to the position of their latest kill. If the
                        player doesn't kill anything before the next time they die, their position is reset to the last
                        checkpoint that they reached. The playe can activate the deathmark by right-clicking.</p>
